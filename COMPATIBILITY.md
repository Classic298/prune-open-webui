# Compatibility Matrix

This document tracks which minimum version of the Prune Tool is required for each Open WebUI version. Use the latest prune release that meets the minimum for your Open WebUI version.

> [!NOTE]
> Find your Open WebUI version in the left column. The right column shows the oldest prune tool release that supports it. Always use the **latest** available prune script version that still supports your version of Open WebUI. You can find all releases in the [Releases](https://github.com/Classic298/prune-open-webui/releases) section — check the release notes to see which Open WebUI versions each release supports.
