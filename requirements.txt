# Requirements for Open WebUI Prune Scripts
#
# These are the additional dependencies needed for the prune scripts
# beyond what Open WebUI already requires.
#
# You need to install the requirements of Open WebUI as well, otherwise things like Vector DB connections will not work.
#
# Install with: pip install -r prune/requirements.txt
# If you use a separate venv to your Open WebUI installation, you also need to install all Open WebUI requirements.
